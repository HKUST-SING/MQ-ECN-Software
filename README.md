#1 What is MQ-ECN
Under construction. 

#2 How to use
##2.1 Compiling
MQ-ECN software prototype is implemented as a Linux queuing discpline (qdisc) kernel module. So you need the kernel headers to compile it. You can find available headers on your system in `/lib/modules`. To install the kernel headers, you just need to use the following commandï¼š
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
</code></pre>

Then you can compile MQ-ECN kernel module:
<pre><code>$ cd sch_dwrr
$ make
</code></pre>

This will produce a kernel module called `sch_dwrr.ko`. I have tested it with Linux kernel 3.18.11. MQ-ECN kernel module is built on the top of <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/sched/sch_tbf.c">Token Bucket Filter (tbf)</a> and <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/sched/sch_drr.c">Deficit Round Robin (drr) scheduler</a> in Linux kernel. 

##2.2 Installing
MQ-ECN replaces token bucket rate limiter module so you can use your existing `tc` tool to install MQ-ECN. So you need to remove `tbf` before you can use MQ-ECN. To install MQ-ECN on a device:

<pre><code>$ rmmod sch_tbf
$ insmod sch_dwrr.ko
$ tc qdisc add dev eth1 root tbf rate 995mbit limit 1000k burst 1000k mtu 66000 peakrate 1000mbit
</code></pre>

In above example, we install MQ-ECN on eth1. The shaping rate is 995Mbps. To accurately reflect switch buffer occupancy, we usually trade a little bandwidth. 

##2.3 Configuring
Except for shaping rate, all the properties of MQ-ECN are configured through `sysctl` interfaces. See `params.h` and `params.c` for more details.
